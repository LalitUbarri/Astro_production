                       The Indian calendar, known as the Shaka Calendar, follows a luni-solar system and exhibits regional variations.

                       Indian festivals occur throughout the year and their dates are determined by various factors, including lunar cycles, solar movements, and religious customs.

                       The lunar calendar plays a pivotal role in determining the dates of Indian festivals. Festivals like Diwali and Eid follow the lunar calendar, which is based on the moon's cycles. The lunar calendar consists of months that commence with the new moon and conclude with the full moon. The festival dates are often determined by the moon's position in relation to the sun.

                       Furthermore, the solar calendar significantly influences the calculation of Indian festivals. This calendar is based on the sun's movement and is used to determine festivals such as Makar Sankranti and Pongal. These festivals are often associated with specific positions of the sun, such as the winter solstice or the sun's transition into a new zodiac sign.

                       Scholars and priests rely on ancient scriptures and texts to calculate the dates of Indian festivals. These texts, including the Panchang or Hindu almanac, contain detailed astronomical calculations, planetary positions, and religious observances. Astrologers and experts interpret these calculations to determine the precise dates and timings of festivals.
