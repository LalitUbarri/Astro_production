                                kaalsarp Dosha, also known as kaalsarp Yoga, is a dosha formed in one's birth chart when all the planets are positioned between Rahu (the northern lunar node) and Ketu (the southern lunar node). This unique planetary alignment is believed to bring about a range of negative effects in an individual's life, including financial troubles, relationship conflicts, health issues, and obstacles in career growth. The severity of the dosha depends on the specific placement of Rahu and Ketu in the birth chart.
